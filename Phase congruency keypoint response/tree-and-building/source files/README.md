LGHD Code
===============

**Article abstract**:
This paper presents a new feature descriptor suitable to the task of matching features points between images with non-linear intensity variations. This includes image pairs with significant illuminations changes, multi-modal image pairs and multi-spectral image pairs. The proposed method describes the neighbourhood of feature points combining frequency and spatial information using multi-scale and multi-oriented Log-Gabor filters.
Experimental results show the validity of the proposed approach and also the improvements with respect to the state of the art.
